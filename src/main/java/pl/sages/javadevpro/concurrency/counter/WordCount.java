            "The F-150 Lightning starts at around $40,000 for a basic work truck (the Pro trim). However, like other F-150s, the Lightning can get considerably fancier and more expensive when you start looking at options and higher trim levels. \n" +

            "\n" +
            "Performance and Capability\n" +
            "Both trucks offer silent, forceful acceleration and excellent handling thanks to powerful electric motors and a low center of gravity. \n" +

The F-150 Lightning's pair of electric motors put out 563 horsepower and 775 pound-feet of torque when mated to the larger battery pack, Ford says. \n" +
